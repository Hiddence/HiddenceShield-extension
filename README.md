## Configuration

Before using the extension, you need to configure it to work with your proxy server:

### Proxy Settings

Open the `js/background.js` file located in the extension's directory and locate the proxy configuration section:

```javascript
const PROXY_HOST = 'proxy.example.com';
const PROXY_PORT = 1080;
const PROXY_SCHEME = 'socks5';

const servers = {
    auto: { 
        host: PROXY_HOST, 
        port: PROXY_PORT,
        scheme: PROXY_SCHEME
    }
};
```

Replace the proxy configuration with your own settings. Modify `host`, `port`, and other values as needed for your proxy server.

## Language Support

The extension supports the following languages:

## Security Considerations

### Avoid Hardcoding Credentials

Hardcoding sensitive information like usernames and passwords directly into the code poses significant security risks:

- **Exposure of Credentials**: If the code is shared or published, your credentials can be accessed by anyone.
- **Unauthorized Access**: Malicious users could use your credentials to access the proxy server or other services.

#### Recommended Solutions:

- **Prompt for Credentials**: Modify the extension to prompt you for your credentials when connecting. Store them securely using `browser.storage.local` with appropriate encryption.

- **External Configuration File**: Store credentials in a separate, non-tracked configuration file. Ensure this file is listed in `.gitignore` to prevent it from being committed to version control.

### Secure Proxy Certificate

If your proxy server uses a self-signed SSL certificate, you may encounter certificate errors in Firefox. To resolve this:

- **Use a Trusted Certificate Authority (CA) Certificate**: Obtain an SSL certificate from a trusted CA for your proxy server domain. This ensures Firefox will trust the proxy's SSL certificate without additional configuration.

- **Manually Trust the Certificate**: Import the proxy's CA certificate into your system's trusted certificate store or Firefox's certificate store.
  - Note: This approach may not be suitable for all users and can pose security risks if not handled properly.
